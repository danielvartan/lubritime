Think `lubritime` is useful? Help others discover it by sharing in person, on social media, or through a blog post. Don't forget to **star** the [GitHub repository][repo]!

Using `lubritime` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing it][citation].

### Propose an Idea üí°

Have an idea for a new `lubritime` feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][issues]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

- Explain in detail how it would work
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a Bug üêõ

Using `lubritime` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

- The content of `utils::sessionInfo()` (Tip: use the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package)
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug

### Improve the Documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

#### The Website

[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: Content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation.

#### Function Documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to the `R` directory in the [code repository][repo]
2. Look for the file with the function
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`)
