## Overview

`lubritime` is an extension for the [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package from tidyverse, adding new features to deal with temporal objects. It's not related in any way with `RStudio` or the `lubridate` developer team.

> Please note that this package is currently on the development stage and have not yet been [peer reviewed](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html).

## Prerequisites

You only need to have some familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to use `lubritime` main functions.

In case you don't feel comfortable with R, we strongly recommend checking Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free and online book [R for data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the Coursera course from John Hopkins University [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) (free for audit students).

## Installation

You can install `lubritime` from GitHub with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gipso/lubritime")
```

## Citation

If you use `lubritime` in your research, please consider citing it. We put a lot of work to build and maintain a free and open-source R package. You can find the `lubritime` citation below.

```{r}
citation("lubritime")
```
